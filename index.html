        <p> Psalm 23: </p>
        
        <p> 1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. </p>

        <p> 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. </p>

        <p> 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. </p>

        <p> 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. </p>

        <p> 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. </p>

        <p> 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. </p>
